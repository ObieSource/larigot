# FiskFan1999's Gemini server.

FiskFan1999/gemini is a library for creating custom gemini daemons. For many use-cases, using a standard file-serving gemini server such as molly-brown or similar will suffice. This library was created because I wanted to emulate the workflow of creating custom webservers using the go net/http standard library. This library abstracts away the internal logic of the gemini protocol, so that a capsule developer only has to worry about responding to requests. The client features support for using proxies and is hardened using configurable download size limits and connection/handshake deadlines.

# Version

This package implements [v0.16.1](./SPECIFICATION.gmi) of the gemini protocol (published January 30, 2022).

# TODO (known bugs)

- Client currently does not verify capsule TLS certificates at all, not even via TOFU strategy.
- Daemon does not implement status 62.
- I am looking for help with hardening the daemon and client against malicious connections
